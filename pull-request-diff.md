I chose to work on the high performance database for embeded systems as my capstone for LGR.
In this initial commit I created an Embeded Database struct and implemented methods of how to
create a new database instance, set a key value pair and also retrieve a value given a key.
I also wrote an integration test to check the persistence of the databse.
